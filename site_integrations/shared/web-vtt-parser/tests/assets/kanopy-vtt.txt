00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.915
THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG

2
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.235
PART ONE –THE DEPARTURE

3
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.151
Is it ready?

4
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.989
The engine still knocks when it’s cold, but that’s normal.

5
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.478
Thanks.

6
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.839
Foucher!

7
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.429
Can you stay an extra hour?

8
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.955
Not tonight,

9
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.435
but I think Pierre’s free.

10
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.149
Pierre, can you stay tonight?

11
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.707
Check the ignition on this gentleman’s Mercedes.

12
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.150
You coming to the game?

13
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.912
No, I can’t.

14
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.992
You going?

15
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.879
Sure am.

16
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.239
Aubin asked me to stay late – no way!

17
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.312
Tonight’s special. I’m going to the theater.

18
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.391
What are they performing?

19
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.232
Carmen.

20
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.551
I don’t like opera.

21
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.597
Movies are better.

22
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.388
I’m going dancing tonight.

23
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.750
Give me a smoke.

24
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.752
All that singing gives me a pain.

25
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.753
I like movies better.

26
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.911
You said that already.

27
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.070
See you guys later.

28
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.393
See you tomorrow.

29
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.869
My love, oh, my love.

30
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.591
Geneviève, my little Geneviève.

31
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.637
Guy, I love you.

32
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.591
You smell like gasoline.

33
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.391
It’s a perfume like any other.

34
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.718
Guy, I love you.

35
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.955
A customer. I have to run.

36
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.356
See you at 8:00 in front of the theater.

37
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.677
I thought about you all day.

38
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.674
If you like, we could go dancing later.

39
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.671
If you wish.

40
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.112
May I help you?

41
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.832
An umbrella.

42
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.039
Where were you?

43
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.229
Just across the street.

44
00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:48.030
Do you know exactly what you’d like?

45
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.437
An umbrella. A black umbrella.

46
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.388
Geneviève, show the gentleman the umbrellas.

47
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.912
Is that you, Guy?

48
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.230
Good evening, Aunt Elise.

49
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.634
Good evening, my boy.

50
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.470
How are your legs?

51
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.594
Fine, my boy.

52
00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.750
What are you up to?

53
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.352
I’m hungry.

54
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.269
You’ll spoil your appetite.

55
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.750
I do as I please.

56
00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.112
Calm down and talk to me.

57
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.190
I don’t have much time.

58
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.598
You seem very nervous.

59
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.672
I’m going out.

60
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.994
Alone?

61
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.118
That’s none of your business.

62
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.596
I think it is.

63
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.512
With a girl.

64
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.272
Do you love her?

65
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.634
Maybe.

66
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.313
Tell me the truth.

67
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.953
Yes, I love her.

68
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.037
What’s wrong? Are you crying?

69
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.197
- Don’t be silly. - Yes, you are.

70
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.829
Is it because you’re all alone?

71
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.718
I’m not alone. I have my books.

72
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.952
Madeleine’s coming to give me my shot.

73
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.709
She’ll keep me company. - What is it, then?

74
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.389
Maybe happiness makes me sad.

75
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.153
That’s silly.

76
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.238
You big brute, you’re messing up my hair.

77
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.074
Good evening, Guy.

78
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.151
Good evening, Madeleine.

79
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.832
You look sad.

80
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.310
You seem happy.

81
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.198
Does it show?

82
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.118
I had a terrible time.

83
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.397
- Doing what? - Persuading Mother.

84
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.551
It was getting late,

85
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.752
and still no sign of the seamstress.

86
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.788
Look.

87
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.959
Careful.

88
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.868
It’s still full of pins.

89
00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.912
You know...

90
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.112
I think she suspects something.

91
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.273
Who?

92
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.113
Mother.

93
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.279
When I said I was going to the theater with Cécile...

94
00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.628
she gave me a funny look.

95
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.833
- What kind of a look? - Like this.

96
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.436
She knows very well that Cécile hates the theater,

97
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.676
and since I’m a very bad liar –

98
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.398
That’s what you say.

99
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.956
No, I assure you, I’m very clumsy at it.

100
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.799
I stammered and blushed

101
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.798
and immediately changed the subject.

102
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.511
Something squeezed.

103
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.678
Something what?

104
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.552
Lemonade.

105
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.278
Same for me.

106
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.193
Do you love me?

107
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.910
A mambo! Come on.

108
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.116
I should have changed shoes.

109
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.000
We’ll have children.

110
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.517
I’ll call my daughter Françoise.

111
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.153
And if it’s a boy?

112
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.351
It’ll be a girl.

113
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.553
We’ve always had girls in the family.

114
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.679
One o’clock!

115
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.189
If Mother isn’t asleep,

116
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.751
I’ll never hear the end of it.

117
00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.276
I should wear makeup, don’t you think?

118
00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.149
No, you’re lovely as you are.

119
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.716
A little bit here.

120
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.756
Where?

121
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.830
There.

122
00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.118
We’ll sell umbrellas.

123
00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.438
No, not umbrellas.

124
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.791
We’ll sell the shop.

125
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.396
We’ll buy a gas station.

126
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.676
Why? What an idea!

127
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.279
All white, with an office. You’ll see.

128
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.949
You’ll smell like gasoline all day.

129
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.951
It’ll be heaven!

130
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.639
We’ll be very happy.

131
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.396
And we’ll always be in love.

132
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.956
Oh, my love.

133
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.752
You haven’t told your mother?

134
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.273
Not yet.

135
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.630
Why? You’re a coward.

136
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.830
You mustn’t be angry.

137
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.236
I know what she’ll say.

138
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.713
What?

139
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.517
"My little girl, you’re crazy. Thinking of marriage at your age!"

140
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.153
My little girl, you’re crazy. Thinking of marriage at 16!

141
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.077
- Seventeen. - In love!

142
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.350
Am I too ugly or too stupid?

143
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.239
No, you’re not ugly. You’re no beauty queen,

144
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.555
but you’re not ugly or dumb.

145
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.830
The thing is, you have plenty of time.

146
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.355
You think you’re in love,

147
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.717
but love is different.

148
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.953
You don’t just fall in love

149
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.676
with some face

150
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.998
you’ve seen in the street.

151
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:57.273
It’s a young man I’ve met several times,

152
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.193
and he loves me.

153
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.397
We want to get married.

154
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.154
Have you nothing to say?

155
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.715
I’m flabbergasted!

156
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.351
I went to the theater with him last night.

157
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.632
Wonderful! So you lied to me,

158
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.310
and you admit it without a speck of shame.

159
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.399
There’s no shame in wanting to get married.

160
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.836
At your age there is.

161
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.996
No, I didn’t mean that.

162
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.756
You’re just a little girl.

163
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.792
You know nothing.

164
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.072
What little you’ve told me certainly doesn’t help.

165
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.754
When I married your father, I knew nothing.

166
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.911
That’s nothing to brag about.

167
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.191
- The hardware store, please. - Next door.

168
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.433
How old is he?

169
00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.073
Twenty.

170
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.115
So of course he hasn’t done his military service.

171
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.632
He lives with his godmother,

172
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.919
the lady who raised him.

173
00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.111
I’m all he has,

174
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.191
and you’ll see,

175
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.318
he’s very handsome.

176
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.596
I’ll see nothing of the kind.

177
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.039
But Mother...

178
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.630
Go upstairs now.

179
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.834
It’s time to fix lunch.

180
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.239
Dear God!

181
00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.999
Geneviève!

182
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.159
We’re ruined!

183
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.836
You always exaggerate.

184
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.039
80,000 francs due by the 15th – you think that’s funny?

185
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.510
And if you don’t pay?

186
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.517
They’ll seize our property.

187
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.989
- I’ll get a job. - What sort of job?

188
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.991
Anything.

189
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.350
At the post office or city hall?

190
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.118
Why not?

191
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.878
You know, if I get married,

192
00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.113
Guy and I will work, and we’ll help you.

193
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.191
My little girl,

194
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.557
getting married is out of the question.

195
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.712
Don’t put those there. You can see you’re in my way.

196
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.355
Anyway, does he have a good job?

197
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.956
Can he support you and raise children?

198
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.677
He’s not rich. We’ll live modestly,

199
00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.753
and we won’t have children right away.

200
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.155
No, but one at least.

201
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.590
Anyway, he won’t be paying my taxes.

202
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.553
There isn’t a penny left in the till.

203
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.438
Sell your jewels.

204
00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.675
Never!

205
00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.394
What good are they? You don’t even look at them.

206
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.755
What if there’s an emergency?

207
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.073
Isn’t what’s happening an emergency?

208
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.074
Impossible! If I sold my jewels...

209
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.359
I’d feel stripped and naked.

210
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.471
Then find something else.

211
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.750
Something else? We have nothing.

212
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.956
Then sell the shop.

213
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.429
Foolish girl! What would we live on?

214
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.036
Well, I guess jewels are just jewels.

215
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.040
Should I try a new hairstyle?

216
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.438
My engagement ring.

217
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.598
It’s atrocious.

218
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.599
This bracelet...

219
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.271
I would never wear it.

220
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.275
No one would want that.

221
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.311
What about your necklace?

222
00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.198
You think?

223
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.269
That’d be a crime. No, I’ll never part with it.

224
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.469
- It’s probably fake anyway. - Come now!

225
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.837
I guess it’s not that pretty after all.

226
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.948
This afternoon we’ll go see Mr. Dubourg.

227
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.590
Then I’ll have my hair done.

228
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.116
What a beauty!

229
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.996
Truly marvelous.

230
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.474
Isn’t it?

231
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.673
A very impressive stone...

232
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:07.358
if I may say so.

233
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.557
Here I have

234
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.949
rubies, sapphires, and emeralds.

235
00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.033
Ali Baba’s cave.

236
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.034
The jewels...

237
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.391
of Sleeping Beauty.

238
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.919
Hello, Mrs. Emery. Hello, Miss Geneviève.

239
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.230
Hello, Mr. Dubourg.

240
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.711
- If you wouldn’t mind...? - Please.

241
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.398
The young lady...

242
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.549
has become a beautiful young woman.

243
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.668
It’s been such a long time...

244
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.719
since I had the pleasure.

245
00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.597
But what can I do for you?

246
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.234
You may speak frankly.

247
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.913
We’re in a very difficult situation.

248
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.517
Geneviève’s grown now and helps me all she can.

249
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.996
It has nothing to do with her.

250
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.680
But I have heavy expenses, and I thought –

251
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.038
Well, I have a payment to meet,

252
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.550
and if I don’t, the consequences will be dire.

253
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.150
So I come to you as to my savior.

254
00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.593
I hesitated a long time, but Geneviève,

255
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.518
the very voice of wisdom and reason,

256
00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.870
convinced me.

257
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.678
It breaks my heart

258
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.997
to be forced to give up

259
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.510
this piece of jewelry, which for me represents –

260
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.749
I understand, dear madame,

261
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.036
but my business entails great risks,

262
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.469
and I’m already overextended.

263
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.474
At best I can put your necklace up for sale,

264
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.151
but for much less than its true worth.

265
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.429
I can’t buy it myself.

266
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.437
Couldn’t you at least give me an advance?

267
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.314
As I said, there’s nothing I can do.

268
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.831
Don’t insist, Mother.

269
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.676
This is a disaster!

270
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:38.991
Excuse me, but I’m interested. I’ll buy your jewelry.

271
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.158
I can help you out of your predicament.

272
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.835
Allow me to introduce myself.

273
00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.511
Roland Cassard, diamond merchant.

274
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.834
But sir –

275
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.951
Don’t worry, madame.

276
00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.272
I’m not a philanthropist.

277
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.799
I’ll easily sell this necklace

278
00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.236
in Paris or London,

279
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.597
where my business takes me quite often.

280
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.277
I don’t know if I should.

281
00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.839
Please. I’m serious.

282
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.548
I’m ashamed, yet delighted at the same time.

283
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.717
I don’t have the cash on me at the moment.

284
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.197
I can write you a check.

285
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.879
There’s no hurry.

286
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.759
Why don’t you stop by tomorrow

287
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.758
at my shop,

288
00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.630
the Umbrellas of Cherbourg?

289
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.711
I’m always there.

290
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.189
Until tomorrow, then.

291
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.272
What time is it?

292
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.717
6:15.

293
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.117
Why hasn’t he come by yet?

294
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.351
Perhaps he’s a crook.

295
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.115
Perhaps he was leading you on.

296
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.833
You’re imagining things.

297
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.877
What’s the matter with you?

298
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.598
Nothing, Mother.

299
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.191
Then stop pacing.

300
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.233
Where are you going? - To see Guy.

301
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.239
I forbid you to see that boy. Stay here.

302
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.392
I wouldn’t want to be disrespectful...

303
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.432
Glad to hear it!

304
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.319
- but I’m going. - You’ll stay here!

305
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.633
Besides, Mr. Cassard will be here soon,

306
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.513
and I’d like you to be here.

307
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.796
- Why? - Because!

308
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.830
If he’s a crook, as you say, we’d better deal with him together.

309
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.032
You think we’re clever enough?

310
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.709
I don’t know, but stay here.

311
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.472
I can’t.

312
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.235
Don’t go. I don’t want you to leave.

313
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.272
I’d given up waiting.

314
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.834
- Are you crying? - It’s nothing.

315
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.673
Sometimes I don’t have the courage

316
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.276
to face my troubles and my debts.

317
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.598
Haven’t I come to help you?

318
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.717
It’s most kind of you.

319
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.032
I saw Miss Geneviève go by.

320
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.118
I’d have liked to –

321
00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.878
She’s gone out.

322
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.999
The life we lead is so sad for a young girl...

323
00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.395
this dreary shop.

324
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.714
I can no longer keep her entertained,

325
00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.355
and I fear she’ll become depressed.

326
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.556
She’s bored here.

327
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.310
Would you care for some tea?

328
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.438
I’d love some.

329
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.077
We just had a terrible fight about you.

330
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.599
About me?

331
00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.872
She wanted to go out. I didn’t want her to, and we quarreled.

332
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.833
We’ve been so lonely since my husband died.

333
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.678
Perhaps you should –

334
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.152
I don’t know – take her to a show.

335
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.838
Perhaps.

336
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.908
Can you come to dinner tomorrow?

337
00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.958
Geneviève would be happy to see you.

338
00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.759
No, that’s impossible. I must leave tonight.

339
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.918
I’m going back to Paris, and tomorrow I’m off to London.

340
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.591
Here’s the money I promised you.

341
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.909
Give Geneviève my best regards,

342
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.754
and I shall not fail...

343
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.592
to come visit you...

344
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.673
next time I’m in town.

345
00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.756
I was so afraid I wouldn’t find you.

346
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.799
I’m so happy to be with you.

347
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.030
I’m laughing because I realize

348
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.517
how foolish I am when I’m alone.

349
00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.999
I talked to Mother about our getting married.

350
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.038
She said I was crazy, of course,

351
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:10.558
and forbade me to see you tonight.

352
00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.914
I was so afraid.

353
00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.673
I’d rather go anywhere,

354
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.274
and never see Mother again,

355
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.914
than lose you.

356
00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.678
We’ll get married in secret.

357
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:38.955
Oh, none of that matters anymore.

358
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.197
There’s no hurry now.

359
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.512
I got my draft notice this morning,

360
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.355
and I’ll be gone for two years.

361
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.313
So we’ll discuss getting married later.

362
00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.913
With the war in Algeria right now,

363
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:07.235
I won’t be back for a long time.

364
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:17.390
But I’ll never be able

365
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.717
to live without you.

366
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.231
I just won’t make it.

367
00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.075
Don’t go or I’ll die.

368
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.075
I’ll hide you

369
00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:36.074
and keep you with me,

370
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:42.396
but don’t leave me, my love.

371
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:50.437
You know that’s impossible.

372
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.348
I’ll never leave you.

373
00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:00.077
My love, I have to go.

374
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.676
I want you to know

375
00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.119
I think only of you,

376
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:13.991
and I know you’ll wait for me.

377
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.350
Two years!

378
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.671
Two years of our lives!

379
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:31.191
Please don’t cry.

380
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.156
Two years – no, I’ll never manage.

381
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.436
Try to be calm. We have so little time left.

382
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.276
So little time, my love, and we mustn’t waste it.

383
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.309
We must try to be happy

384
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.753
and treasure from our last moments together

385
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.873
a beautiful memory,

386
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:09.672
a memory to help us go on living.

387
00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:15.876
I’m so afraid when I’m alone.

388
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.675
We’ll be reunited and stronger than ever.

389
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.190
You’ll meet other women

390
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.517
and forget me.

391
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.838
I will love you

392
00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:34.829
to my dying day.

393
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.791
Guy, I love you.

394
00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.196
Don’t leave me.

395
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.795
My love, don’t leave me.

396
00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.432
Come.

397
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.799
Come, my love.

398
00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.270
Oh, my love!

399
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.957
Is that you, Guy?

400
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.593
Good evening, Aunt Elise.

401
00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.597
Are you in bed?

402
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.429
I don’t feel too well.

403
00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.074
Is there anything you want?

404
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.836
No, nothing.

405
00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.834
I just need to rest.

406
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.035
Good night, my child.

407
00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.271
I’m afraid.

408
00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:32.713
I love you.

409
00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.917
Where have you been?

410
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.911
With Guy.

411
00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.712
What did you do?

412
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.194
He’s leaving.

413
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.880
He’ll be gone for two years.

414
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.958
I can’t live without him.

415
00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.036
I’ll simply die.

416
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.071
Stop your crying.

417
00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.516
Look at me.

418
00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.998
People only die of love in the movies.

419
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.237
It’s too cruel.

420
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.513
Being separated is cruel,

421
00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.868
that’s true.

422
00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:51.711
But time sets things right.

423
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.351
You speak of love,

424
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.948
but what do you know of love?

425
00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.673
Are you sure of your feelings?

426
00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:08.151
Mother, can’t you see how unhappy I am?

427
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.237
I know, darling, I know.

428
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:18.992
I too have loved and struggled and suffered.

429
00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.032
You should listen to me. - I do listen.

430
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.749
Isn’t it better to wait?

431
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.034
Two years from now

432
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.550
you may have forgotten Guy completely.

433
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:38.712
No, I’ll never forget him.

434
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.192
If you still love him when he returns, you’ll see.

435
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.479
You must believe me and calm down

436
00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.430
and forget about this whole matter.

437
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.916
Have you had dinner?

438
00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.798
Yes, Mother.

439
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.711
Have some fruit.

440
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:08.032
You need to get your mind off things, go out and have fun.

441
00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.629
It’s not so hard.

442
00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.514
You’re young and pretty, with a quick wit.

443
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:26.077
You’ll make friends your age... or maybe older.

444
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.829
Mr. Cassard came by this evening.

445
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.753
He was sorry he missed you.

446
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.158
I’m sure he could give you some good advice.

447
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:41.552
I can do without his advice, thank you.

448
00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:45.514
You’re wrong. I think he’s just the kind of man –

449
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.240
Stop going on about that guy.

450
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.555
You look terrible.

451
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.156
Leave me alone, Mother.

452
00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.271
At least give me a kiss.

453
00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.392
Trust me. You’ll see.

454
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:23.150
Look at me, my boy.

455
00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.870
I don’t know

456
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:31.034
if I’ll still be alive when you return.

457
00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.154
But Elise!

458
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:38.109
No, no "buts." I’ve had a good life.

459
00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:42.068
I can leave this world without regret.

460
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.872
This is nonsense.

461
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.399
Right, Madeleine?

462
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.075
Of course. She’s doing better already.

463
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.393
I’ll meet death before you do.

464
00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.949
Joining the army doesn’t mean going to war.

465
00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.235
Before you go, I want you to know

466
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.029
that everything I have will be yours.

467
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.238
Don’t forget about me.

468
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:14.149
Write me from time to time.

469
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.269
Madeleine will keep you informed.

470
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.677
Farewell, my child.

471
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.195
My love...

472
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.358
I’ll wait for you

473
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.597
all my life.

474
00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.314
I’ll think only of you.

475
00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.994
Stay, don’t go,

476
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.272
I beg you.

477
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.033
Stay, my love.

478
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.518
It’s not time yet.

479
00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.030
I’m leaving now.

480
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.829
Don’t watch me go.

481
00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.835
I can’t.

482
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.870
I just can’t.

483
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.911
My love.

484
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.759
I love you.

485
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:42.913
PART TWO – THE ABSENCE

486
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.319
Well?

487
00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.078
Well what?

488
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.999
You’re pale as a ghost.

489
00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.149
What did the doctor say?

490
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.992
Nothing, really.

491
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.953
That I should rest.

492
00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.993
You didn’t need to see a doctor for that.

493
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.709
I could have told you that myself.

494
00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.319
What else?

495
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.273
He gave me a prescription.

496
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.518
Sedatives, tonics – just stuff.

497
00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:44.996
"Just stuff"? Then it can’t be very serious.

498
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.918
You know, if the shop were doing better,

499
00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.077
I’d be the happiest woman in the world.

500
00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.395
It’s freezing.

501
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.713
You know whom I met in town?

502
00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.155
Guess. You don’t want to?

503
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.636
Roland Cassard. Have you nothing to say?

504
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.513
What do you want me to say?

505
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.716
He’s so incredibly nice!

506
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.037
We talked for over an hour this morning.

507
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.312
He’s back from the U.S.A. What a man!

508
00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:23.872
He told me a thousand stories. I invited him to dinner.

509
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.118
What’s the matter?

510
00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.198
Nothing. I’m just tired.

511
00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.156
That’s no reason to sulk like that.

512
00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.272
You may be fatigued, but you’re not dying.

513
00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.954
It’s not the fatigue that saddens me.

514
00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.270
It’s the silence.

515
00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:54.235
Guy left two months ago, and he’s only written once.

516
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.920
Don’t start that again.

517
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.189
If I knew where he was, I could write to him.

518
00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:06.712
I’m sure they’ve sent him somewhere dangerous

519
00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.638
where he’s risking his life.

520
00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.233
It’s much simpler.

521
00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.952
Simpler how?

522
00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.349
He’s forgotten you.

523
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.431
You don’t know what you’re saying!

524
00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.718
If he were thinking of you, he would write.

525
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.316
One can always write, no matter the distance.

526
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.948
It’s nothing.

527
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.994
I got so scared.

528
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.311
I suddenly saw Guy laughing

529
00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.029
with another woman.

530
00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.391
Come sit down.

531
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.991
I’ll close the shop.

532
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.550
You’re hiding something.

533
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.278
No, I’m not.

534
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.875
It’s serious, isn’t it?

535
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.839
I’m pregnant, Mother.

536
00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.475
This is horrible! Pregnant by Guy?

537
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.309
How could this happen?

538
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.955
The usual way, I assure you.

539
00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.072
Stop joking. This is serious.

540
00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.270
What are we going to do?

541
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.949
What do you mean?

542
00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.793
- With the child. - We’ll bring it up.

543
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.957
- What will we say? - To whom?

544
00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.152
I don’t know. Our neighbors, our friends.

545
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.788
We have no friends,

546
00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.515
and you never speak to the neighbors.

547
00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.439
And Roland Cassard is coming to dinner!

548
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.869
We’ll have to welcome him and put on a good front.

549
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.152
With the way you look – and pregnant!

550
00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.390
You needn’t tell him.

551
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.158
Be quiet.

552
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.195
I tremble just thinking about it.

553
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:10.635
Go upstairs and lie down.

554
00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.313
I feel just fine.

555
00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.477
Don’t argue. Obey me.

556
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.432
I’ll fix dinner myself.

557
00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.552
Don’t worry.

558
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.159
Perhaps you need some rest.

559
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:09.037
Yes, Geneviève’s been overdoing it lately.

560
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.470
She’s a bit pale.

561
00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:16.156
Why don’t you go live in the country?

562
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:21.230
The situation we find ourselves in

563
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:25.115
is such that, at least for the time being,

564
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.959
we can’t get away.

565
00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.317
Geneviève wouldn’t go alone,

566
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:36.270
and I can’t leave the shop.

567
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.837
There’s no way out.

568
00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:43.676
It seems you two can’t be separated.

569
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:48.836
We’ve practically never been parted.

570
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.314
I haven’t found the bean.

571
00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.988
I found it.

572
00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:01.798
You must pick a king and make a wish.

573
00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.480
I have no choice.

574
00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.190
You are my king.

575
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.192
Thank you, Geneviève.

576
00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.868
Put this crown on.

577
00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:18.751
Do as he asks, Geneviève, and put it on.

578
00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.713
You look like

579
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:37.998
a Virgin with Child I saw in Antwerp.

580
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.600
My cheeks are burning.

581
00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.668
How funny! I think I drank too much.

582
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.750
I’ll leave you now.

583
00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.075
I’m not feeling too well.

584
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.236
Then I’ll be going.

585
00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:06.952
Please, let’s you and I chat a bit longer.

586
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.917
Good night, my darling.

587
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.956
I’m really worried.

588
00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.795
Geneviève is sad and reserved and keeps to herself.

589
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:39.272
I admit I may not always be tactful and understanding enough.

590
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:42.034
I’m always afraid of hurting her.

591
00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.958
I don’t want to sound ridiculous,

592
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:51.116
and my feelings could seem insincere.

593
00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.592
I wouldn’t want you to misinterpret

594
00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.711
what I’m suggesting,

595
00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.917
for my only desire

596
00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.429
is to bring happiness.

597
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.951
I don’t know if I’ve made myself clear.

598
00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.476
To be honest, I don’t understand.

599
00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.514
Since the beginning of dinner

600
00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:27.673
I’ve been trying to broach a subject that’s on my mind,

601
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:31.833
but my shyness got the better of my feelings.

602
00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.149
I came to ask for Geneviève’s hand.

603
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.950
I know I’m terribly clumsy.

604
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.798
Not at all,

605
00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.354
but this is so unexpected.

606
00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:47.030
Geneviève is still a child in my eyes,

607
00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:51.836
and the suddenness of your request is a bit unsettling.

608
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:57.793
You see, I don’t know Geneviève’s feelings for you.

609
00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:02.318
She’s only spoken of you in friendly terms.

610
00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:08.357
I wouldn’t want to pressure her in any way.

611
00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:14.273
We know nothing about you.

612
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.955
Once, years ago...

613
00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.154
I loved a woman.

614
00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.353
She didn’t love me.

615
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.994
Her name was Lola.

616
00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:34.078
This was years ago.

617
00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.471
I was disappointed

618
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.160
and tried to forget her.

619
00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.193
I left France...

620
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:49.600
and traveled to the ends of the earth.

621
00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:55.836
But life held no allure for me.

622
00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:00.070
Then, by chance. . .

623
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.876
our paths crossed.

624
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.955
The moment...

625
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.392
I saw Geneviève...

626
00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.318
I knew I’d been waiting for her.

627
00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:19.193
Ever since I met her,

628
00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:23.029
life’s taken on new meaning.

629
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.955
I see her constantly before me.

630
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.955
I live only for her

631
00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.432
and think only of her.

632
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.593
I wanted...

633
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.671
to speak to you frankly.

634
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.155
Please don’t be offended.

635
00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.478
Of course, I wouldn’t think

636
00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:55.349
of influencing Geneviève.

637
00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.751
Geneviève...

638
00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:01.590
is free.

639
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:17.319
Tomorrow I go back to Amsterdam for three months.

640
00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:22.793
Upon my return, Geneviève can give me her answer.

641
00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.510
I don’t know what to say.

642
00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.594
No need to say a thing.

643
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:34.038
Geneviève will decide for herself.

644
00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.393
- You’re not asleep? - You can see I’m not.

645
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:05.075
Roland Cassard asked me for your hand.

646
00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.635
I was listening.

647
00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.314
You didn’t tell him I was pregnant?

648
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.229
I didn’t dare.

649
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:03.758
I’m very proud of you.

650
00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.799
François is a pretty name for a boy.

651
00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.076
Time passes slowly here.

652
00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:13.391
All leaves have been suspended,

653
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.199
and I don’t know...

654
00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:21.312
whether I’ll be returning to France anytime soon.

655
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.870
My love, I know you’re waiting for me.

656
00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.677
Last night one of our patrols

657
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.997
fell into an ambush.

658
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.276
Three soldiers were killed.

659
00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.715
All the same, I don ’t think

660
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:41.515
that there ’s any great danger here.

661
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:47.395
But it’s strange how sun and death

662
00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:51.269
travel together.

663
00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:59.558
Geneviève, come and eat, darling.

664
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.828
"Dear Mr. Cassard,

665
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.997
Mother and I

666
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:35.511
greatly appreciated your postcard."

667
00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.754
I find all those people ridiculous.

668
00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.911
I hate carnival.

669
00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:47.594
Don’t be bitter, my darling.

670
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.954
It’s incredible how big you are!

671
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:56.512
You’re carrying in front. It will be a boy – or twins.

672
00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.074
No, everything’s normal.

673
00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:01.675
I feel wonderful.

674
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:04.792
You’re like me. I was delighted, and never sick.

675
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.270
The day before you were born, I was up on a ladder,

676
00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.199
changing the wallpaper in the shop.

677
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.869
Has the mailman come?

678
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.073
There was nothing but bills

679
00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:22.279
and some advertising.

680
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.598
Why? Are you still waiting?

681
00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.989
In his last letter he wrote

682
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:37.239
that he was sad he wouldn’t see me pregnant.

683
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:41.315
Perhaps it’s just as well. I look awful.

684
00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:45.479
A pregnant woman is always beautiful, sweetheart.

685
00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.952
That’s true.

686
00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:52.550
Look at this.

687
00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:57.716
A little top, and I saw pretty rompers at the department store.

688
00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.990
Admit you’re pleased.

689
01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.516
I’d be more pleased if the child had a father,

690
01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.875
and if you had a husband.

691
01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.309
Guy will come back.

692
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.718
Guy... or someone else.

693
01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:19.112
Absence is a funny thing.

694
01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:24.631
It feels like Guy’s been gone for years.

695
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.151
When I look at this picture,

696
01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.794
I forget what he really looks like.

697
01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.239
And when I think of him, it’s this picture I see.

698
01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:38.872
It’s all I have left of him.

699
01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.073
You mustn’t smoke. Be reasonable.

700
01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.872
What’s that?

701
01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.031
A postcard from Hamburg

702
01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.116
from Roland Cassard.

703
01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.392
- For me? - For us. You can read it.

704
01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.873
He says he’ll be back soon.

705
01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.751
He asks if you’ve thought it over.

706
01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.798
I don’t think there’s any hurry.

707
01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.556
No, but you should give it some thought.

708
01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.520
I am, Mother.

709
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.791
A man comes along who’s rich and refined

710
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.474
and smitten with you, and I think –

711
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.956
What are you doing?

712
01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.311
Aren’t you feeling well?

713
01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.237
I’m fine.

714
01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.115
- You’re eating? - I can’t help it. I’m always hungry.

715
01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.112
He’s not a womanizer or a smooth talker on the prowl,

716
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.392
but a man who’s lived and suffered.

717
01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.834
I know, Mother, but spare me the sales pitch.

718
01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.748
You talk about him like he’s one of your umbrellas.

719
01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.554
Because he’ll protect you!

720
01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.954
Very funny!

721
01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.595
If you can’t take a little joke, you’re in sad shape.

722
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.795
Guy may have been your ideal,

723
01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.679
but what future does he offer you?

724
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.830
You know I was wooed once too

725
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.878
by a young man who was not your father.

726
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.992
You’d have done better to marry him.

727
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.037
You’re right.

728
01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.596
But try to understand that I want you to be happy

729
01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:38.030
and not waste your life like I wasted mine.

730
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:41.357
Don’t worry about my life, Mother.

731
01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:45.150
I have no intention whatsoever

732
01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.034
of wasting it.

733
01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.475
Do you think Cassard will want to marry me

734
01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.353
when he sees I’ve been knocked up?

735
01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.033
Watch your language!

736
01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.111
All deformed and swollen up!

737
01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.232
Neither you nor I had the courage

738
01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.597
to tell him the truth.

739
01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.549
At least now it will show!

740
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.718
Do you think he’ll take me like this?

741
01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.030
If he refuses me as I am,

742
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.430
it means he doesn’t have

743
01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.716
deep feelings for me.

744
01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:28.236
If, by some extraordinary chance, he accepts me,

745
01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.397
I’ll have no reason to doubt him,

746
01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.711
and I’d be a fool to turn him away.

747
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:38.233
So you see, I’ve been thinking it over,

748
01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.591
but this is all so difficult.

749
01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.400
Why is absence

750
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.593
so heavy to bear?

751
01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:07.317
Why is Guy growing so distant?

752
01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:15.954
I would have died for him.

753
01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:24.031
So why aren’t I dead?

754
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.469
Look.

755
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.352
What is it?

756
01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.192
It’s for you.

757
01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.434
Roland sent it.

758
01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:55.832
I can’t accept it.

759
01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.150
Do as you like.

760
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.634
We’ll bring this child up together.

761
01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.277
It will be our child.

762
01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.434
Please say yes.

763
01:05:30.279 --> 01:05:33.352
Geneviève...

764
01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.558
I don’t want all this...

765
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.275
to cause you the slightest grief.

766
01:05:43.279 --> 01:05:45.794
I love you...

767
01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:49.437
Geneviève.

768
01:06:00.279 --> 01:06:02.396
She accepts your offer,

769
01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:08.635
seeing how you’re not put off by the situation she’s in.

770
01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.876
But don’t rush her.

771
01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.349
She’s so fragile

772
01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.710
that the slightest false step

773
01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.792
could compromise everything.

774
01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:40.674
PART THREE – THE RETURN

775
01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.555
NEW OWNER

776
01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:39.433
Madeleine told me everything.

777
01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.950
Why didn’t you say anything?

778
01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.718
I didn’t want to.

779
01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.712
I thought you knew.

780
01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:49.755
Didn’t you suspect anything?

781
01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.716
Of course.

782
01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.868
The last few months her letters weren’t the same.

783
01:08:57.399 --> 01:09:00.631
She didn’t answer my questions.

784
01:09:01.559 --> 01:09:04.279
She wrote without conviction.

785
01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:08.474
But to marry another man!

786
01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:13.193
I just thought she was mad at me, but I didn’t know why.

787
01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:16.238
Then there was the hospital

788
01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:19.558
and my letters that went unanswered.

789
01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:26.073
Nothing’s changed here.

790
01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.117
I have.

791
01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.800
Now I can go

792
01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.751
since you’ve come back.

793
01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.277
I’d have been unhappy not to see you again.

794
01:09:39.559 --> 01:09:41.551
Don’t talk nonsense.

795
01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.036
Now make yourself useful, my boy.

796
01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:48.756
Get me a little herb tea.

797
01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:51.591
Everything’s ready

798
01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.398
in the kitchen.

799
01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.115
There’s water in the kettle.

800
01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.434
Does your leg hurt?

801
01:10:01.559 --> 01:10:04.199
I limp a bit now.

802
01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:13.514
It’s like having a barometer in my knee.

803
01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.110
Especially when it rains.

804
01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.750
The hospital was the worst part of all.

805
01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.789
But how did it happen?

806
01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.995
Returning one night from maneuvers...

807
01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.709
we were attacked with hand grenades.

808
01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.831
It was a common occurrence.

809
01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.268
And Madeleine?

810
01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.635
She’ll be here soon.

811
01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.832
She’s been very good to me.

812
01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.638
She’s not married yet?

813
01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:50.154
You know how sensible she is.

814
01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.919
Put this over there on the table.

815
01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.673
What will you do now?

816
01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.196
Work...

817
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.551
or maybe live off my pension.

818
01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:17.276
Aubin promised to take you back at the garage.

819
01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.076
You liked it there.

820
01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.875
Oh, there, or some other garage.

821
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.515
We’ll see. I have time. There’s no hurry.

822
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:37.827
The child she was expecting – you know anything about it?

823
01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.636
No, Geneviève left right after the wedding.

824
01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.994
Mrs. Emery stayed

825
01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.631
in Cherbourg a month or two.

826
01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:53.511
Then she sold the shop.

827
01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.071
I think they’re in Paris.

828
01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.072
You haven’t changed.

829
01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.709
I’m happy

830
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.549
that you’re back.

831
01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.559
Foucher!

832
01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.438
The boss wants you.

833
01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.868
Shit!

834
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.468
Did you service this gentleman’s car?

835
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.879
A complete checkup on the 26th, right?

836
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.075
It threw two rods this morning. The engine has to be rebuilt!

837
01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.839
A brand new engine – without a drop of oil!

838
01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.430
I’m not accusing anyone, but those are the facts.

839
01:13:44.559 --> 01:13:47.597
- Did you check the oil gauge? - Of course.

840
01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.957
- You forgot to tighten the plug. - I know my job!

841
01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.991
Change your tone of voice,

842
01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.832
and apologize to the gentleman!

843
01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.396
I have nothing to apologize for!

844
01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.795
You don’t give a damn about your work now.

845
01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.799
Why don’t you buy new overalls and shave before coming to work?

846
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.758
I’ve had enough! I’ll find another job!

847
01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.033
Ever since that jerk got out of the service

848
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.714
he’s been acting like a hoodlum.

849
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.270
What’s gotten into you?

850
01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.198
I’m quitting.

851
01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:27.030
I got into it with Aubin and quit before he could fire me.

852
01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.519
What will you do?

853
01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.756
Live off my pension.

854
01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.751
A dry white wine.

855
01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.592
Another one.

856
01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.397
Take it out of this.

857
01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.115
You don’t have change?

858
01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.910
You’re all the same with your big bills.

859
01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.798
What’s it to you?

860
01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.757
Do your job and lay off.

861
01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.598
Oh, yeah?

862
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.518
Drop it.

863
01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.197
What are you looking for?

864
01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.230
Nothing.

865
01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.436
Then move your ass.

866
01:16:19.559 --> 01:16:21.551
You’re in the way.

867
01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.952
Cognac.

868
01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.956
Want to dance?

869
01:17:14.559 --> 01:17:16.550
Leave me alone.

870
01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.630
Something wrong, baby?

871
01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.832
Come with me, if you’d like.

872
01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.629
You’re really

873
01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:52.911
a sweet girl.

874
01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.675
Bye, Madame Germaine.

875
01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.077
Bye, Jenny.

876
01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.673
You can call me Geneviève

877
01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.791
if you’d like.

878
01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:46.473
You’re going to say I remind you of someone.

879
01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.955
Good-bye, Jenny.

880
01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.600
Come back anytime.

881
01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.510
Sorry, Madeleine.

882
01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.235
I didn’t have my key.

883
01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.317
What’s the matter?

884
01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:28.318
Elise died

885
01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.556
last night.

886
01:19:57.559 --> 01:20:02.680
I can’t stay

887
01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:06.152
in this apartment any longer.

888
01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.470
It makes me too sad.

889
01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.717
I want to leave soon.

890
01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.713
But where will you go?

891
01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.751
I don’t know.

892
01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.388
You have no family.

893
01:20:19.559 --> 01:20:23.269
Don’t you want to stay here?

894
01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:26.631
- Why? - To help me.

895
01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:30.549
I’ll be all alone.

896
01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:34.877
You don’t need anyone.

897
01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:39.239
I do. I need you, Madeleine.

898
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:45.954
Why not just admit you don’t like being alone?

899
01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:52.678
I don’t see how I could help.

900
01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:56.713
I have no influence over you.

901
01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.754
That’s not true.

902
01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:09.793
I don’t like what you’ve become.

903
01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.839
- What’s that? - An idle loafer.

904
01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:17.316
You’re sad and bitter.

905
01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.393
You’ve changed a lot.

906
01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.716
It’s not my fault.

907
01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:27.709
Nothing’s made sense ever since I came back.

908
01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.276
I don’t believe I can help you.

909
01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:35.237
You’re too far away.

910
01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:38.830
What if I asked you to try

911
01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.679
despite everything?

912
01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:46.152
I’d stay without a moment’s hesitation.

913
01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:50.112
I’m asking you now.

914
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:54.075
Then I’ll try.

915
01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.309
I’m a little late.

916
01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.913
The lawyer took forever,

917
01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.873
and I stopped by the garage.

918
01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:51.717
Everything’s all settled.

919
01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.076
Poor Elise.

920
01:22:54.559 --> 01:22:57.632
Nothing will be left of her.

921
01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:00.593
Oh, no. Just the opposite.

922
01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:04.038
She’ll be part of all we do.

923
01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.712
- Are you happy? - Very.

924
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.878
And I owe it all to you.

925
01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:17.074
It’s true, and you know it.

926
01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.916
And you? Are you happy?

927
01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:28.108
Oh, I’m not unhappy.

928
01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.196
I wanted to say –

929
01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.670
I mean, I’ve been thinking that if you wanted

930
01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.950
to share my life...

931
01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:42.758
if I weren’t too much of a burden...

932
01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:45.590
and – Are you crying?

933
01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.597
No.

934
01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.315
Did I say the wrong thing?

935
01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:54.632
Not at all.

936
01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.991
It makes me so happy,

937
01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.153
yet at the same time it scares me.

938
01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.271
You’re scared of me?

939
01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.238
No, I mean... that is...

940
01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:08.316
you understand.

941
01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:13.635
Have you stopped thinking about Geneviève?

942
01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:17.157
Are you sure you really love me?

943
01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:20.318
I’m not scared, but I do wonder

944
01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:24.195
if you’re not acting out of despair.

945
01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.039
No, you’re entirely wrong.

946
01:24:27.559 --> 01:24:30.791
I don’t want to think about Geneviève anymore.

947
01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:34.032
I assure you I’ve forgotten everything.

948
01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:37.830
I want to be happy with you.

949
01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.072
Madeleine, don’t cry.

950
01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.232
I don’t have much ambition,

951
01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.513
but if I could make this dream come true...

952
01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.151
of being happy with a woman

953
01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:59.468
in a life we’ve chosen

954
01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.429
together...

955
01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:24.958
All done.

956
01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.752
It’s beautiful.

957
01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.558
You think so?

958
01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.510
Your hands are cold.

959
01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.393
I’m going out for a while.

960
01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.071
Whatever you like.

961
01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.193
Our little boy wants to see the toys in the shop windows.

962
01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.437
He’s been talking about it for a week.

963
01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:00.868
We’ll go quickly before dinner.

964
01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.914
Stop that, François.

965
01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.391
You’ll make us deaf.

966
01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:14.032
I got you a lovely Christmas present.

967
01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.513
What is it?

968
01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:18.518
It’s a surprise. You’ll see.

969
01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.395
Cover up well.

970
01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.835
I love you, Guy.

971
01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:40.952
François, come put your coat on.

972
01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:51.634
Say hi to Santa Claus for me.

973
01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.311
See you in a while.

974
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.833
Françoise, stop that.

975
01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.152
The horn is not a toy.

976
01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.751
It’s cold.

977
01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.476
Come in the office.

978
01:28:18.559 --> 01:28:21.916
It’s better in here.

979
01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.472
This is my first time back in Cherbourg

980
01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.992
since I got married.

981
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.312
I went to pick up my daughter

982
01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:46.557
at my mother-in-law’s in Anjou.

983
01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.875
On my way back to Paris

984
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.390
I decided to make a detour.

985
01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:01.511
I never thought I’d run into you.

986
01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:05.432
As fate would have it...

987
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.719
Fill it up, ma’am?

988
01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.473
Yes, fill it up.

989
01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.471
Super or regular?

990
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.477
It doesn’t matter.

991
01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.636
Whichever you prefer. Super?

992
01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:30.270
It’s a pretty tree.

993
01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.595
Did you decorate it?

994
01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:37.038
No, my wife did. It’s mostly for the kid.

995
01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.272
Of course.

996
01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:46.111
Are you in mourning?

997
01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:49.232
Mother died last autumn.

998
01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:00.153
What did you name her?

999
01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:02.271
Françoise.

1000
01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:05.791
She’s so much like you.

1001
01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.234
Do you want to see her?

1002
01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:17.318
I think you can go now.

1003
01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.794
Are you doing well?
